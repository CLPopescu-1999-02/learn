<ul>
	<li>Continuous monitoring, every mains cycle is sampled exactly 50 times.</li>
	<li>Uses 2 current transformers &ndash; suitable for a &ldquo;Type 2&rdquo; installation.</li>
	<li>Normal transmission to emonGLCD via the RFM12 every few seconds, this also takes account of every mains cycle so you won&rsquo;t miss short peaks.</li>
	<li>Support for a single DS18B20 temperature sensor.</li>
	<li>Standard, unmodified emonTx hardware, the triac trigger is driven from the pulse detector jack via a suitable resistor.</li>
	<li>Diverted power is calculated and transmitted to emonGLCD.</li>
	<li>Triac pulses can be manually set via the serial interface (e.g. enter 2 to pulse every second mains cycle &ndash; remember to put this back to 0!)</li>
	<li>Upper and lower energy thresholds can be set to minimise flicker.</li>
	<li>The design uses one of the ATmega328 timers to interrupt the Arduino sketch approximately every 400 microseconds. The exact timer period is determined by a software phase-locked loop which ensures that the first voltage sample is aligned to the rising zero crossing and the 26<sup>th</sup> sample is aligned to the falling zero crossing. This means that the samples are always taken in the same place on every cycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sampling process occupies about 30% of the CPU time so there&rsquo;s plenty left for other tasks like transmission, temperature measurement, print statements etc. These are completely decoupled from the timing loop so they don&#39;t interfere with the sampling in any way.</p>
