## Costs

Note: When comparing different generating technologies the unit costs below only show part of the story, for a full comparison, backup, storage, transmission and distribution costs also need to be taken into account.

Maintanence costs are based on annual O&M cost estimates available on renewablesfirst.co.uk, with costs for turbines where this information is not available estimated at £40/kW/year.

The costs above do not include business rates, wind turbine insurance, financing or network costs which increase the final cost of the delivered electricity.

The cost of wind generated electricity has fallen significantly over the last 40 years, the following graphic on the left illustrates the extent of these cost reductions for wind power in the US with a fall of 10x from $0.55/kWh to $0.05/kWh. With these cost reductions installation rates have rocketed with over 63 GW of wind having been installed in the US between 2001 and 2015. Total global wind capacity in 2015 reached 432.4 GW.

|----------|--------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| 1kW      | 2500-3000          | £2,750.00 | £110.00 | £0.126    |
| 2kW      | 3000-5000          | £2,000.00 | £80.00  | £0.091    |
| 3kW      | 5000-6000          | £1,833.00 | £73.32  | £0.084    |
| 4kW      | 6000-7000          | £1,625.00 | £65.00  | £0.074    |

Overview of Solar PV costs in the UK 2016:

- [http://www.theecoexperts.co.uk/4-kw-solar-pv-systems](http://www.theecoexperts.co.uk/4-kw-solar-pv-systems)

Typical retail costs for the Solar PV panels themselves in the UK late 2016 is around £600/kW which is around 30% of the total installation cost estimates above:

- Navitron: [Renesolar 245W, £140.43 ex VAT](http://www.navitron.org.uk/renesola-245w-poly-virtus-ii-jc245m-24b-b-40mm)
- Wind and Sun [260 Wp REC Peak Energy module, silver frame £155.62 ex VAT](http://www.windandsun.co.uk/products/Solar-PV-Panels/REC-Solar-PV-Panels/REC-Peak-Energy-Series#.WD1VHLVKbCI)

**Solar cost reductions and capacity growth**

As in the case of wind, the cost of solar has also fallen significantly over the last 40 years.

### Anaerobic Digestion

Anaerobic digestion plants with gas turbine generators with or without heat recovery could potentially be used as a dispatchable backup supply. In ZeroCarbonBritain biogas from AD is combined with hydrogen from electrolysis via the sebatier process in order to produce more methane from a given amount of input biomass. The AD system costs below are for the direct AD plant with power generation.

| Capacity | Name         | Total Cost    | £/kW      |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| 75kW     | Case Study 1 | £506,921.00   | £6,758.95 |
| 499kW    | Case Study 2 | £1,364,085.00 | £2,733.64 |
| 190kW    | Case Study 3 | £953,176.00   | £5,016.72 |
| 105kW    | Case Study 4 | £480,054.00   | £4,571.94 |
| 250kW    | Case Study 5 | £822,122.00   | £3,288.49 |
| 250kW    | Case Study 6 | £876,590.00   | £3,506.36 |
| 75kW     | Case Study 7 | £464,489.00   | £6,193.19 |
| 861kW    | Case Study 8 | £3,157,036.00 | £3,666.71 |

**Example gas engine** The [GE Jenbacher type 2](https://powergen.gepower.com/products/reciprocating-engines/jenbacher-type-2.html) is one example gas engine used in conjunction with biogas plants. It achieves an electrical efficiency when powered with biogas of 38.70%. The Jenbacher type 2 supports heat recovery for Combined Heat and Power with a thermal efficiency of 48.50%. Bringing the total efficiency to 87.30%. The cost of reciprocating engines are in the order of £400-600/kW [[1]](http://www.mrwmd.org/archives/2007%20Board%20Meeting/December/MRWMDDec07_8_Purchase_Of_Jenbacher_Memo.pdf) [[2]](http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2015-Annual-Boston/Proceedings/Tuesday/3B.1Koenig.pdf)
