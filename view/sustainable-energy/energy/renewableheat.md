# Renewable Heat

There are a number of different approaches to providing space and water heating with a renewable supply. Perhaps the two most well known renewable heat technologies are heat pumps powered by renewable electricity and biomass heat.

The key limitation with biomass heat is of course land use. Land availability for energy is scarce. Growing biomass for energy on a large scale reduces the amount of land available for growing food and in future other demands such as carbon sequestration.

Heat pumps with the bulk of their power from renewable electricity: primarily wind and solar provides the opportunity to reduce the amount of land required for biomass energy significantly, however there is still a need for a backup electricity supply when the wind is not blowing. The hourly energy model suggests that around 75% of a heat pumps electricity demand can be supplied directly from a wind and solar supply mix (at equal capacities of each) with 25% needing to be sourced from a backup supply. This backup requirement stretches several orders of magnitude beyond the capacity of today’s battery technologies and so another solution is required. ZeroCarbonBritain uses biomass and excess hydrogen to generate large quantities of methane gas which can then be burnt in gas turbines to generate the backup electricity required.

The following section explores 10 different renewable heat approaches from biomass only approaches to combinations of biomass, heat pumps, CHP and finally biomass as a backup for heat pumps running off primarily wind and solar electricity. It explores the land use implications of each approach.

A household heat demand of 6100 kWh/year for hot water and space heating is used, which is based on a just over 50% saving from better insulation and draft proofing. The land areas discussed below would be slightly more than double if building fabric energy efficiency remained at today’s levels.

## Biomass only

#### High efficiency biomass boilers 8-14%

High efficiency biomass boilers have an efficiency that typically exceeds 90%, such as the Okofen Pellematic (Calorific efficiency of 98.7%), the Eco Angus Log batch boiler (92%), or Froling T4 (94.2%). 

6100 kWh/year or 16.7 kWh per day of heat demand translates to a dry biomass demand of 16.7 kWh/d / 0.92 = 18.2 kWh/d dry biomass input at 92% efficiency.

A estimated further 10-20% is lost in production**, drying the wood chip or pellet feed stock, chipping & pelletising. If we assume the lower bound of 10% (assuming a high degree of air-drying), 20.2 kWh/d of dry biomass input is required to provide 16.7 kWh/d of heat.

The following table with yield amounts given in the ZeroCarbonBritain land use methodology** give the power density of different biomass energy sources:

| | odt/ha/yr | kWh/ha/yr | kWh/m2/yr | W/m2 | TWh/Mha |
|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------|---------|------|
| Productive Broadleaf Woodland | 0.38 | 1793.6 | 0.18 | 0.02 | 1.8 |
| Productive Coniferous Woodland | 0.8 | 3776 | 0.38 | 0.04 | 3.8 |
| Short Rotation Forestry (SRF) | 2.77 | 13074.4 | 1.31 | 0.15 | 13.1 |
| Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) | 12 | 56640 | 5.66 | 0.65 | 56.6 |
| Miscanthus | 14.5 | 68440 | 6.84 | 0.78 | 68.4 |
| Rotational Grasses | 9.5 | 44840 | 4.48 | 0.51 | 44.8 |
| Hemp | 6.75 | 31860 | 3.19 | 0.36 | 31.9 |

*odt: oven dried tonnes, Modt: Mega oven dried tonnes.*<br>
*4.72 Twh/Modt, 17 MJ/kg, 4720 kWh/odt*

Oven dried tonnes per hectare per year are converted here to power production, per unit area (Watts/m2) for easier comparison with David MacKay’s chart and analysis: http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c6/page_43.shtml

20.2 kWh/d is equivalent to 842 Watts continuous power. Wood chips and pellets can be produced from broadleaf woodland, coniferous woodland, short rotation forestry, short rotation coppice and miscanthus.

The highest yield is provided for by miscanthus 0.78 W/m2. Using miscanthus would require 842 Watts / 0.78 W/m2 = 1080 m2 per household.

If we divide the land area of the UK by 26 million households we arrive at 9231m per household and so direct biomass heat with miscanthus would use about 12% of UK land area.

Another way to picture the land area required per household might be to compare it with the size of football pitch at 7350 m2. One household would require 15% of a football field, or alternatively two times the area of a typical penalty box.

If short rotation coppice was used instead of miscanthus this would increase to just under 1300 m2 or 14% of UK land area.

If productive coniferous woodland was used we would need 21,050 m2/household or 2.3x the UK land area, increasing to 4.6x UK land area with productive broadleaf woodland. Given that a large degree of biomass heat today is from these slower growing sources it highlights the need to develop the higher yielding crops if we are to achieve a sustainable level of land use at scale.

ZeroCarbonBritain suggests that yields for SRC and miscanthus can be improved by a cautious 50%**. With such an improvement SRC would provide 0.975 W/m2 and Miscanthus: 1.17 W/m2. Resulting in land area use of 9.4% and 7.7% respectively.

#### "Grass for gas" standard AD (26%)

An alternative approach is the production of biogas, injected into the gas grid from Anaerobic Digestion plants. Anaerobic digestion converts wet biomass in to biogas at an energy efficiency of 60%***.

AD requires wet biomass such as rotational grasses. These have an energy content of about 0.51 W/m2. Converted to biogas the energy content is equivalent to 0.31 W/m2. Assuming no losses associated with transportation in the gas network and a gas boiler efficiency of 92% resulting in a gas demand of 18.2 kWh/d or 756W. 2440 m2 of rotational grasses are required, equivalent to 26% of UK land area if scaled up for all households.

#### "Grass for gas" with enhanced sebatier processing (16%)

Biogas from Anaerobic Digestion has a relatively high CO2 content** . ZeroCarbonBritain suggests the addition of sebatier reactors to AD plants that can combine hydrogen generated from excess wind and solar electricity with CO2 from the AD biogas to create a larger quantity of methane.

2.0 kWh of biomass + 1.0 kWh of hydrogen = 2.0 kWh of synthetic methane

With sebatier enhanced anaerobic digestion, methane gas could be produced at a power production per unit area of 0.51W/m2 which would reduce the amount of land required to 1482m2 or 16%. Which is not far off our estimate for the land area requirement of short rotation coppice in biomass boilers above.

## Heat pumps & Biomass backup

The next series of examples explore the addition of heat pumps starting with heat pumps powered solely from electricity generated from biomass and then adding in renewably electricity from wind and solar with biomass electricity used as a backup.

#### Heat pumps + standard AD (21% biomass only, 5.1% wind & solar backup)

We start here again with rotational grasses at a land efficiency of 0.51W/m2. 40% of the energy content is lost in conversion to biogas. Standard high efficiency electricity generating gas engines** in AD plants have efficiencies of the order of 40% resulting in electricity at a land efficiency of 0.1224 W/m2. A heat pump then converts this to a heat efficiency of 0.3672 W/m2. Our heat demand was 16.7 kWh/d or 696 Watts.

0.51 W/m2 x 0.6 x 0.4 x 3.0 =  0.3672 W/m2
696 Watts /  0.3672 W/m2 = 1895m2, or 21% of UK land area

If standard AD is only used as a backup electricity source covering 25% of the electricity demand the land area requirement for the biomass backup would be:

75% wind and solar, 25% biomass backup =  1895m2 x 0.25 = 474 m2 (5.1%)

#### Heat pumps + standard AD + CHP heat recovery (14% biomass only, 3.6% wind & solar backup)

Very similar to our standard AD only example above, reciprocating gas engines with an electrical efficiency of 40% also support heat recovery of up 50%. 

This utilises an additional 0.153 W/m2 above 0.3672 W/m2 achieved with power generation only. Reaching 0.5202 W/m2

100% biomass: 696 Watts / 0.52W/m2 = 1338 m2 (14%)

75% wind and solar, 25% biomass backup =  1338m2 x 0.25 = 335 m2 (3.6%)

#### Heat pumps + sebatier enhanced AD (10% biomass only, 2.5% wind & solar backup)

We start here again with rotational grasses at a land efficiency of 0.51W/m2. 0.51W/m2 of higher quality methane is produced. This can then be burnt at up to 60% efficiency in large CCGT gas turbines. Although 50% may be more representative and is the efficiency used in ZeroCarbonBritain. The electricity produced has a land efficiency of 0.255 W/m2

A heat pump then converts this to a heat efficiency of 0.765 W/m2. Our heat demand was 16.7 kWh/d or 696 Watts.

696 Watts /  0.3672 W/m2 = 910m2, or 10% of UK land area

75% wind and solar, 25% biomass backup =  910m2 x 0.25 = 228 m2 (2.5%)

#### Heat pumps + CHP Wood gasifiers (5.1% to 9.2% biomass only, 1.3% to 2.3% Wind & Solar backup)

An alternative to the use of wet biomass and anaerobic digestion is to use woody biomass such as short rotation coppice and miscanthus with a gasifier.
Typical efficiencies for gasifiers are less than what can be achieved with biogas.
Electrical efficiencies of 20-30% and Heat efficiencies of 50-60% are possible.

    Heat recovery: 1.17×0.9×0.5=0.5265

75% wind and solar, 25% biomass backup =  472m2 x 0.25 = 118 m2 (1.3%)

    SRC 0.975 W/m2
    Heat pump heat: 0.975x0.9×0.3×3=0.78975 
    Heat recovery: 0.975×0.9×0.5=0.43875
    Total: 1.23W/m2, 567m2 (6.1%)

75% wind and solar, 25% biomass backup =  567m2 x 0.25 = 141 m2 (1.5%)

#### Heat pumps with direct biomass boiler backup (1.9% to 3.5%)

An alternative to supplying backup electricity for heat pumps generated from biomass is to use a combination of a heat pump and a biomass boiler usually known as bivalent heat pump heating. Bivalent systems are usually installed where the heat pump cannot cover all heat demand or where the COP of typically an air-source heat pump drops below a particular level due to extreme cold ambient conditions. In these conditions the heat pump system is either supplemented by a backup heating system or the system switches over completely. This function could be extended to use the backup heating system where wind and solar supply low.

If we assume as above that 75% of the heat pumps electricity demand is provided by wind and solar electricity and that the backup requirement remains at 25% of demand this means that we need: 

    16.7 kWh/d head demand x 0.25 = 4.2 kWh/d of backup heat

Provided for in a 92% efficient biomass boiler this results in a dry biomass demand of: 

    4.2 kWh/d backup heat / 0.92 = 4.5 kWh/d dry biomass backup

Assuming a further energy loss of 10% in drying and processing as in our biomass boiler only example above results in an input biomass requirement of:

    4.5 kWh/d dry wood chip/pellets / 0.9 = 5.0 kWh/d (208 Watts) wet woody biomass

| Crop | Yield | Land area per household |
| ---- | ----- | --- |
| Miscanthus | 0.78 W/m2 | 267 m2 (2.9%) |
| Miscanthus (150%) | 1.17 W/m2 | 178 m2 (1.9%) |
| SRC | 0.650 W/m2 | 320 m2 (3.5%) |
| SRC (150%) | 0.975 W/m2 | 213 m2 (2.3%) |

These estimates suggest that using direct biomass boilers for backup in this way might use 35% more land area than the minimum land area that might be achievable with a wood gasifier CHP system running at high efficiency.

Another way of looking at it could be to assess both methods in comparison with a 100% biomass baseline, in this case the bivalent system would reduce land area requirement by 75% and the CHP wood gasifier system by 84% providing an additional 9% saving.

**More detailed modelling would be required to assess the impact of low outside temperatures on heat pump COP with an assessment of benefits of reducing heat pump requirements both at times of low wind and solar output and low temperatures.
